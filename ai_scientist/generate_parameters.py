You have already done some research on the idea and found some relevant papers. 
However, you will also need several different sorts of agents to run your experiment in the given ABM environment. 

You are now tasked with finding the relevant agents and parameters for these agents. 

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify the agents that could help you run your experiments.
Then, use the web to search for the relevant parameters for the agents you have identified. 
Ensure that your answers are correct and relevant to the idea and the agents you have identified. Also ensure that the parameters are relevant to the ABM environment (the environment is written in JAX). 

In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following fields:
