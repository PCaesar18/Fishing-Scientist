        "Experiment": "Enable the government agent in the simulation environment to implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI) policy, providing all agents with a baseline income. Adjust tax policies to fund the UBI and analyze the effects on wealth distribution, agent productivity, and overall economic equality. Explore different UBI levels and tax structures to identify optimal policies for reducing inequality without harming productivity.",

        "Experiment": "Modify the simulation environment to introduce age-based skill distributions for agents. Younger agents will have higher crafting and gathering skills, while older agents will specialize in trading and policy-making. Simulate the effects of an aging population on productivity, income inequality, and government tax policies. Analyze how government interventions like immigration policies or tax incentives impact economic outcomes over time.",

Modify the environment to account for emissions associated with different resources and activities. Evaluate the effects on economic productivity, resource allocation, and wealth distribution across agents. The government sets tax rates for emissions, and the policy's impact on agent behavior and economic indicators is analyzed.",

        "Experiment": "Modify the simulation environment to introduce a 'technological revolution' that randomly enhances the productivity of a subset of agents. This can be done by temporarily boosting their crafting and gathering skills. Evaluate the impact on economic productivity, income inequality, and the effectiveness of government policies (like taxation) in mitigating any negative effects. Analyze how such technological changes can lead to greater inequality if not managed correctly, and the role of government in ensuring equitable distribution of technological benefits.",
